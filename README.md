# Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-learning
Fraud is one of the major issues we come up majorly in banks, life insurance, health insurance, and many others. These major frauds are dependent on the person who is trying to sell you the fake product or service, if you are matured enough to decide what is wrong then you will never get into any fraud transactions. But one such fraud that has been increasing a lot these days is fraud in making payments.As this is a problem of binary classification, I will use a Logistic Regression algorithm, as it is one of the most powerful algorithms for a binary classification model.Well, what was the last time when you got an accuracy of 100 per cent. Our fraud detection model gave an accuracy of 100 per cent by using the logistic regression algorithm.
